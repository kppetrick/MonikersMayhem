[plan]
# Core design principles Cursor should follow
"Use a single React app with /tv and /play routes."
"Backend must be Node.js + Express + Socket.io."
"Game state is authoritative on the server (no client-side source of truth)."
"Follow the round structure and game flow defined in the README."
"Implement drafting, rounds, and scoring incrementally according to MVP-TASKLIST.md."
"Prefer clear, modular code in server/game, server/socket, and client/src/components."
"Do not introduce external backend frameworks beyond Express and Socket.io."
"Keep all storage local (SQLite or JSON) for MVP; no cloud dependencies."

[style]
# General coding preferences
"Use TypeScript for new frontend files if practical; otherwise, keep React components simple and typed later."
"Use modern React with hooks (no class components)."
"Use functional, small components over giant monolith components."
"Prefer pure functions in game logic files (rounds, drafting, scoring)."

[restrictions]
# Things NOT to do
"Do not add authentication or passwords; profiles are matched by name + birthday."
"Do not add complex permissions beyond host vs non-host."
"Do not add external services (Firebase, Supabase, Auth0, etc.) for MVP."
"Do not over-engineer state management (no Redux needed for MVP)."

[testing]
# Testing hints for Cursor
"Focus early tests on gameState helpers, drafting logic, and scoring functions."
"Where possible, write small unit-style helpers for things like draft analytics, age buckets, and card weighting."
